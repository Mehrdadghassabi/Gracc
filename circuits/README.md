# How to give Gracc an input via text?
- well, we got to descript a circuit (kirchoff_graph) with a text file to do so: </br>
in the first line of the text write two number, the first one is nodes_number and the second is edges_number </br>
in the next n lines (n = edges_number) you've got to explain the edges details </br>
such that ( x y z a b c ) means that node x and y are </br>
connected with a z_ohm resistor , a_volt battery , b_farad capacitor & c_henry inductor
- for example consider <a href=https://github.com/Mehrdadghassabi/Gracc/blob/master/circuits/circuit1.txt>
circuit1</a> as an input,
it is descripting this circuit
